# Project Summary

## Purpose and Main Functionality
The project is designed to create a client-server system for a Raspberry Pi equipped with various hardware components such as a RealSense camera, servo motors, and an audio detection system. The primary functionalities include:
- Capturing and processing video and audio data.
- Controlling servo motors based on commands received from a server.
- Communicating with a server through WebSockets.
- Operating in both real and simulated hardware environments for development and testing purposes.

## Key Components and Interactions
- **WebSocketClient**: Manages WebSocket connections, sends telemetry and camera frames, and receives commands from the server.
- **RealSenseCamera**: Captures color and depth frames using an Intel RealSense camera.
- **ServoController**: Controls servo motors to adjust physical movements based on server commands.
- **AudioDetector**: Analyzes audio signals to determine sound levels and directions.
- **MessageHandler**: Responsible for sending and receiving messages to/from the server (implementation details are not fully provided in the provided code).

These components primarily interact through the `WebSocketClient`, which orchestrates the flow of data and commands between the server and local hardware components.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python 3**: The main programming language used.
- **asyncio and websockets**: For asynchronous programming and WebSocket communication.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Handles image processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations, especially in handling image data.
- **RPi.GPIO, adafruit-blinka**: Interface with the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi for hardware control.
- **Logging**: For logging information, warnings, and errors.
- **Argparse**: To parse command-line options.

## Notable Implementation Details
- The system supports a simulation mode, allowing development and testing without actual hardware.
- Implements an exponential backoff strategy for reconnecting to the server in case of connection losses.
- Telemetry data includes system metrics like CPU temperature, memory usage, and uptime, sent periodically to the server.
- Designed to be modular, with each hardware component encapsulated in its class, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- Asynchronous programming is utilized to efficiently handle real-time data processing and communication.

Overall, the system is structured to be robust and modular, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability. The use of asynchronous programming ensures efficient real-time data processing and communication.
